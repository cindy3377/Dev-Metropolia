Team meetings were hold 2 times to work on the project SuomiSprint and we collaborated successfully. I was responsible for Form to publish the learning courses and Course description.
Each group member exhibited exceptional collaboration. Each member excelled in their role in the tasks, they managed their part efficiently and productively, maintained high motivation levels and responsibilities in the project work.

Reflection:
Challenges Faced:
During this week, I encountered several challenges. One of the main challenges was related to time management. Balancing the workload from both the Web Course and the Project Course was more demanding than I anticipated. Additionally, I faced some coding difficulties when implementing certain features for our project, particularly when dealing with asynchronous operations and React Hook and Database connected.
What Went Well and Lessons Learned:
Despite the challenges, there were some positive outcomes. We successfully completed the initial setup of our API server and implemented the basic endpoints. This experience taught me the importance of breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. It also reinforced the significance of teamwork and collaboration.
Key Learning:
One of the key learning points from this week was gaining a deeper understanding of how to create an API server and set up endpoints. I also learned more about handling asynchronous operations in Node.js and utilizing MongoDB for data storage. Additionally, I improved my knowledge of routing and controller functions.
Online Resources:
I found a few online resources extremely useful during this week

-     	Tutorial on setting up a Node.js API server provided step-by-step guidance, which was invaluable during our project.
-     	The MongoDB documentation helped me troubleshoot database-related issues and better understand its features.
  Coping Strategies:
  To manage the workload effectively, I established a weekly schedule that allocated specific time slots for both courses. This helped me stay on track and meet deadlines. Additionally, I utilized time management techniques, such as the Pomodoro method, to maintain focus during coding sessions.
  Academic Progress:
  In terms of academic progress, I successfully completed all assignments and submitted them on time. I received positive feedback on some assignments, which boosted my confidence. However, I also identified areas where I need improvement and plan to seek additional resources to enhance my knowledge.
  Soft Skills Development:
  Collaboration and communication were critical skills that contributed significantly to our progress this week. Effective communication within the group ensured that everyone was on the same page and reduced misunderstandings. I also improved my problem-solving skills when tackling coding challenges.
  Project Management:
  Agile project management principles greatly influenced our approach to project work. We adopted a flexible approach, regularly reviewed our progress, and made adjustments as needed. This allowed us to adapt to changing requirements and maintain a steady pace of development.
  Final Thoughts:
  Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in both the Web Course and the Project Course. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge. It was a valuable learning experience, and I feel more confident in my abilities.
  Next Steps:
  For the upcoming week, my goals and intentions include:
- Further exploring advanced features of MongoDB to enhance our project's database functionality.
- Strengthening my understanding of asynchronous programming in Node.js., React Hooks and front end settings.
- Improving my time management skills to balance coursework effectively.
- Continuing to collaborate effectively with my team members and maintaining clear communication in order to reach the best results.
