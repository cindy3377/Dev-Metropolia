Each group member's ability to collaborate was good and effective. Each member express well their roles in the tasks, they managed their part efficiently and productively, they own good motivation and responsibilities in the project work.

**Challenges Faced:**
Adapting to new technologies such as Node.js and React presented initial challenges. Coordinating schedules for team meetings was also a hurdle due to varying academic commitments.

**What Went Well and Lessons Learned:**
We successfully established our development environment and gained valuable insights into JavaScript engines, Node.js fundamentals, and React components. Understanding how functions are treated as first-class citizens and utilizing arrow functions enhanced our coding efficiency. Embracing NPM for dependency management and Git for version control streamlined our workflow.

**Key Learning:**
The significance of using Node Package Manager (NPM) for dependency management and Git for version control became clear. We also learned to create interactive user interfaces with React components, JSX, and the Virtual DOM.

**Online Resources:**

- The Net Ninja's React tutorial series provided comprehensive guidance on React components and JSX.
- GitHub's documentation offered insights into version control using Git and GitHub.

**Coping Strategies:**
We effectively communicated challenges, sharing insights from online resources, and collaboratively resolved issues. Implementing a rotating meeting schedule enabled productive discussions.

**Academic Progress:**
We successfully set up our development environment, initiated a React project, and learned about Node.js fundamentals. Individually, we managed to fulfill academic commitments and submit assignments.

**Soft Skills Development:**
Our communication and collaboration skills played a pivotal role in problem-solving and efficient task delegation. Constructive feedback enriched our teamwork.

**Project Management:**
We adopted agile principles by breaking the project into smaller user stories. We successfully defined a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and initiated Scrum methodology for efficient project management.

**Final Thoughts:**
Reflecting on the week, our team's dedication and adaptability have been inspiring. Overcoming challenges and embracing new concepts has paved the way for exciting project development.

**Next Steps:**
In the upcoming week, we plan to delve deeper into React and explore advanced state management concepts. Regular stand-up meetings will be implemented to track progress efficiently, enhancing our agile approach.
