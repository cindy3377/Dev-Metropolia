Reflection:
Challenges Faced:
This week presented several challenges. I encountered difficulties understanding the concepts of filter(), find(), and forEach() during the Backend session. Time management became a concern, especially with multiple submissions and project sessions.
What Went Well and Lessons Learned:
Despite the challenges, I successfully grasped the concepts of Express.js: Routers and Controllers. This led to a more efficient workflow in our project work. I also learned the importance of effective time management and scheduling in managing coursework and independent study materials. Communication within our group improved as we learned to adapt to each other's schedules.
Key Learning:
This week, I solidified my understanding of Express.js and gained valuable insights into asynchronous JavaScript. The concepts of MVC in project development were particularly enlightening and will significantly influence my future work. Furthermore, the importance of clear communication among team members became evident during our group presentation.
Online Resources:

- The video on Express JS Crash Course was instrumental in clarifying router and controller concepts.
- Asynchronous JavaScript in ~10 Minutes was a concise resource that greatly aided my understanding.
  Coping Strategies:
  To manage challenges effectively, I prioritized tasks, allocated specific time slots for independent study, and maintained open lines of communication with my group members. Peer discussions and seeking help when needed were vital strategies for overcoming difficulties.
  Academic Progress:
  I successfully submitted all assignments on time and received satisfactory grades. This week's academic progress reinforced the importance of time management and consistent effort.
  Soft Skills Development:
  Improved communication and collaboration skills played a crucial role in our group's success. Resolving scheduling conflicts and maintaining motivation showed significant growth in my soft skills.
  Project Management:
  Adopting agile project management principles helped streamline our group project. We adapted to changing requirements and timelines, ensuring a smoother workflow and better collaboration.
  Final Thoughts:
  Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the Web Course and Project Course. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.
  Next Steps:
  For the upcoming week, I plan to focus on mastering React Router and enhancing my understanding of the MVC framework. Additionally, I aim to further improve my time management skills to ensure a balanced workload and a successful group project outcome.
