Each group member's ability to collaborate was good and effective. Each member express well their roles in the tasks, they managed their part efficiently and productively, they own good motivation and responsibilities in the project work.

**Challenges Faced:**
This week brought challenges related to understanding the intricacies of Express in the back-end and working with React Lists in the front-end. Additionally, managing Git branches and coordinating our schedules proved to be a bit challenging.

**What Went Well and Lessons Learned:**
We successfully grasped the concepts of Express and middleware implementation, which allowed us to create more dynamic back-end functionalities. Learning about Scrum principles, particularly the difference between INVITE and DEEP, helped us streamline project collaboration. Git branching strategies became clearer, leading to better version control. Additionally, working with React Lists and exploring styling techniques was a fruitful learning experience.

**Key Learning:**
Our understanding of Express framework and middleware improved significantly, enabling us to build more interactive back-end features. We gained a deeper understanding of Scrum methodology, enhancing our project management approach. Git branching strategies enhanced our collaborative coding efficiency. Familiarizing ourselves with React Lists and styling techniques boosted our front-end development skills.

**Online Resources:**

- We found the Express.js documentation invaluable in understanding how to set up routes and middleware effectively.
- The Atlassian website provided comprehensive explanations of Scrum concepts and the differences between INVITE and DEEP.
- GitHub's documentation on branching strategies helped us implement a more organized version control workflow.

**Coping Strategies:**
To overcome scheduling conflicts, we introduced a shared calendar for the team and scheduled regular stand-up meetings to ensure clear communication. Challenges with Express and React Lists were addressed by discussing concepts as a group and seeking assistance from online tutorials.

**Academic Progress:**
We successfully completed the implementation of dynamic routes using Express in our project. Individually, we met our academic commitments and achieved satisfactory grades.

**Soft Skills Development:**
Our communication skills proved essential in coordinating our schedules and effectively discussing coding challenges. Collaborative decision-making helped us choose the most suitable Scrum approach for our project.

**Project Management:**
We applied Scrum methodologies and effectively utilized Trello to manage tasks and track progress. Learning about the differences between INVITE and DEEP enhanced our understanding of Scrum principles.

**Final Thoughts:**
This week's challenges allowed us to strengthen our technical skills while also improving our project management and communication abilities. The combination of practical coding and theoretical project management knowledge is proving to be a rewarding experience.

**Next Steps:**
In the upcoming week, we plan to focus on enhancing our front-end skills further by diving into styling techniques and incorporating React Lists effectively. We are also excited to apply our learning to a mini full-stack app and explore independent study topics such as flexbox, Figma, and UI/UX.
