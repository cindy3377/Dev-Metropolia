During Week 5, I made significant progress in both my Web Course and Project Course. I successfully tackled several coding challenges and improved my understanding of key concepts. My time management was on point, allowing me to stay on track with assignments and project work.

Self Assessment week 6: grade 5
Week 6 brought its fair share of challenges. I faced some coding difficulties, particularly in the backend testing area. Managing my time effectively became a bit more challenging as the workload increased. However, I managed to overcome these obstacles with perseverance and by seeking help from my peers and online resources.

Assess your learning and growth throughout Week 7:
Week 7 was all about growth. I learned a lot of new concepts related to backend development and custom hooks in React. These skills have added depth to my knowledge and will undoubtedly be valuable in my future projects.

I also had peer pairing in Front-end on Tuesday with Berhanu and Back-end on Thursday with Amir. Even though there were some difficulties in communication, we finally managed to finish the pair projects and upload to GitHub. I invited Sami as our collaborator already.

Reflection
Challenges Faced:

- One of the main challenges I faced during this week was related to backend testing. Writing effective tests for the backend proved to be more challenging than expected, especially when dealing with databases and API routes.
- Balancing my workload between the Web Course and Project Course was another challenge. I had to carefully manage my time to ensure I made progress in both areas.

What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

- Despite the challenges, I managed to make some progress. I successfully completed coding tasks and gained a deeper understanding of backend development and custom hooks in React.
- One valuable lesson I learned was the importance of seeking help when facing challenges. Consulting online resources, like tutorials and forums, was incredibly helpful in overcoming coding difficulties.

Key Learning:

- I learned about the distinction between development, production, and testing environments and how to manage them effectively.
- Backend testing was a significant focus, and I became familiar with tools like Jest, and Supertest, Mocha and Chai for testing APIs.
- Custom hooks in React opened up new possibilities for reusing logic between components, which will streamline my future frontend development work.

Online Resources:

- I found the "Testing Express REST API With Jest & Supertest" video tutorial to be highly informative for backend testing.
- "React JWT Authentication" was a helpful resource for understanding authentication in React applications.
- "localStorage in JavaScript: A complete guide" provided in-depth insights into using localStorage effectively.

Coping Strategies:

- When faced with coding difficulties, I took a step-by-step approach, breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks.
- Regular communication with my peers helped me stay on track and address any issues that arose.

Academic Progress:

- I completed all assignments for both the Web Course and Project Course.

Soft Skills Development:

- My soft skills, including communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, played a significant role in my progress during the week. Effective communication within the group helped us overcome challenges together.
- Problem-solving skills were honed while tackling coding challenges, especially in the backend testing aspect.

Project Management:

- Agile project management principles influenced our approach to project work and collaboration. We divided tasks into sprints, set deadlines, and maintained regular progress checks, which kept us on track.

Final Thoughts:
Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the Web Course and Project Course. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.

Next Steps:
For the upcoming week, I plan to focus on further improving my backend testing skills, particularly with Jest and Supertest. Additionally, I aim to explore custom hooks in React more deeply and apply them in our project. Overall, I'm committed to maintaining a proactive and collaborative approach to learning and working with my team.
