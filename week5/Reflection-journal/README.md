Team meetings were hold one time to work on the project SuomiSprint and we collaborated successfully. I was responsible for creating a page for teachers to publish the learning courses and Course description.
Each group member exhibited exceptional collaboration. Each member excelled in their role in the tasks, they managed their part efficiently and productively, maintained high motivation levels and responsibilities in the project work.

**Challenges Faced:**
This week has been quite challenging, especially in the context of my web course and project course. I encountered difficulties in understanding and implementing the useReducer function in React. It was a new concept for me, and I struggled to grasp its full potential. Additionally, time management became an issue as I tried to balance coursework and project work effectively.

**What Went Well and Lessons Learned:**
Despite the challenges, there were some positive outcomes this week. I successfully completed several coding tasks related to my web course, albeit with some initial difficulties. This process taught me the importance of persistence and seeking help when needed. Additionally, I learned valuable lessons about time management, realizing that breaking tasks into smaller, manageable chunks can significantly improve productivity.

**Key Learning:**
The most significant learning point for me this week was understanding the useReducer function in React. The knowledge is pivotal for my web development skills, and I look forward to implementing it in future projects.

**Online Resources:**
I found a comprehensive guide titled Understanding useReducer in React: A Comprehensive Guide extremely useful. It explained the concept, advantages, disadvantages, and provided practical examples of code refactoring from useState to useReducer. This resource clarified many of my doubts and helped me apply the knowledge effectively.

**Coping Strategies:**
To cope with the challenges, I adopted a proactive approach to try to solve the problems that I have even though Iâ€™m still stuck with a lot of coding errors. Additionally, I implemented time management techniques, such as using a task list and setting specific time blocks for studying and project work.

**Academic Progress:**
In terms of academic progress, I managed to complete all assignments and received satisfactory grades. While I still have room for improvement, I noticed that my coding skills are steadily improving.

**Soft Skills Development:**
My soft skills, especially communication and problem-solving, played a significant role in my progress this week. Communicating with peers helped me understand complex concepts better, and my problem-solving skills were put to the test while tackling coding challenges.

**Project Management:**
The principles of agile project management influenced my project work significantly. I broke down the project into smaller tasks, set milestones, and regularly checked progress. This approach kept the project on track and facilitated effective collaboration with my team members.

**Final Thoughts:**
Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the web course and project course. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.

**Next Steps:**
Week 2 Goals (Starting on [Next Week Date]):

1. Dive deeper into useReducer in React, applying it to real-world projects.
2. Improve time management further by setting more detailed schedules.
3. Continue seeking online resources and tutorials to enhance my understanding of web development.
4. Collaborate actively with my project team and apply agile principles to ensure project success.
